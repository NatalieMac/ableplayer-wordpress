HTML5 accessible media player

== Description ==

This plug-in uses Able Player, an open-source fully-accessible cross-browser HTML5 media player, to embed audio or video within your WordPress page.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the unzipped folder `ableplayer` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
1. Activate the Able Player plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Follow the Instructions for Use

== Instructions for Use ==

This is an early pre-release version of this plugin, designed to make it possible and fairly easy to add an Able Player instance to a WordPress site.

To use it, simply enter or paste any valid HTML5 Able Player code into your web page.

Full documentation, including a list and explanation of all supported HTML5 attributes, is available on the [Able Player](http://ableplayer.github.io/ableplayer) project page on GitHub.


== Next Steps ==
1. Tighten CSS within Able Player so player styles are less likely to be overridden by WordPress theme styles.
1. Provide a user interface by which authors can select and configure options through WordPress rather than typing in HTML.
1. Interface directly with existing WordPress media libraries so users can select their media files and other assets rather than typing in URLs.
1. Consider whether and how best to support shortcodes.
