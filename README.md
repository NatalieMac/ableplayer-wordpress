Able Player for WordPress
=========================

*Able Player* is a fully accessible cross-browser HTML5 media player for audio and video. 

This plugin is designed to simplify the process of adding Able Player to WordPress websites. 

See the main [Able Player](http://ableplayer.github.io/ableplayer) project page for more details about Able Player.
    
Contributing
-------------

This is an early pre-release version of this plugin, designed to make it possible and fairly easy to add an Able Player instance to a WordPress site.

To use it, simply enter or paste any valid HTML5 Able Player code into your web page. Anyone who has interest in the project and WordPress development skills, please feel free to log [issues](https://github.com/ableplayer/ableplayer-wordpress/issues) and/or contribute pull requests. 

Issues that only effect Able Player in WordPress should be addressed in this repo. However, issues that might effect Able Player in other contexts should be addressed in the [Able Player repo](https://github.com/ableplayer/ableplayer). 

### Roadmap  

Below are the major next steps in the project:   

1. Tighten CSS within the main Able Player repo so player styles are less likely to be overridden by WordPress theme styles.
2. Provide a user interface by which authors can select and configure options through WordPress rather than typing in HTML.
3. Interface directly with existing WordPress media libraries so users can select their media files and other assets rather than typing in URLs.
4. Consider whether and how best to support shortcodes.
